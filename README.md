Role-Based User Management System is a backend application built using Java and Spring Boot that demonstrates secure user authentication and authorization using JWT.
The system supports role-based access control, where users can register and log in, while administrators can manage users and roles.
It follows a layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository) and implements best practices such as password encryption, RESTful APIs, and centralized exception handling.
